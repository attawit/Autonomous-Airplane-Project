Autonomous Airplane Project
=============================
Spring 2012 Berkeley EECS 149 -- Introduction to Embedded Systems

### Group Members
- Fang, Eugene
- Haddad, Fadi
- Khalilnaji, Saba
- Lee, Alex
- Yeung, Nick

### Setup
- Open ArduPlane/ArduPlane.pde with the Arduino software.

### Notable Folders
- ArduPlane: Contains the source for the ArduPlane project
- TestFiles: Contains Arduino sketches to test functionality of certain components
- Libraries: Contains default Arduino and ArduPlane libraries

### Important Note
Please keep all test code in the TestFiles folder. This way the ArduPlane project will stay as condensed as possible and we won't have to go back and clean it up later.
